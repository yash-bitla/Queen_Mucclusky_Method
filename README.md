# Queen_Mucclusky_Method
A Boolean function is a function that produces a Boolean value output by logical calculation of Boolean inputs. It plays key roles in programing algorithms and design of circuits. Minimization of Boolean function is able to optimize the algorithms and circuits. Quine-McCluskey (QM) method is one of the most powerful techniques to simplify Boolean expressions. Compared to other techniques, QM method is more executable and can handle more variables. In addition, QM method is easier to be implemented in computer programs, which makes it an efficient technique. There are several versions of QM simulation codes online, whereas some of them appear to have limitations of variables numbers or lack the consideration of Don’t-Care conditions. Here a QM simulation code based on C programing is introduced. Theoretically it is able to handle any number of variables and has taken the Don’tCare conditions into account.
